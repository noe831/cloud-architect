<h1>Designing and Planning a Cloud Solution Architecture</h1>

<h2>Module Overview (Video)</h2>
Module 1 covers designing and planning cloud solutions, focusing on Cymbal Direct's architecture needs. It aligns with the first section of the Professional Cloud Architect Exam Guide. You will assess your skills with 10 diagnostic questions, review them, and identify study resources based on your learning needs.

<h2>Designing and Planning a Cloud Solution Architecture (video)</h2>
In this module, you’ll learn how to design and plan cloud architecture for Cymbal Direct, focusing on assessing their current environment, defining business and technical requirements, and planning the migration to Google Cloud. Key tasks include evaluating existing systems, proposing solutions, and creating a migration plan. You'll explore how to use diagnostic questions to identify knowledge gaps and use resources to address them. Additionally, you’ll consider future improvements and how to adapt solutions as business needs evolve.

<h2>Introduction: Diagnostic questions for module 1 (video) </h2>
You'll now assess your experience with diagnostic questions to identify areas needing focus in your study plan. Complete the questions to guide your study, and use the course workbook if your learning platform doesn't support assessments.

<h3>General Approach</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Diagnostic questions may be complex with multiple layers or decisions. They help identify areas needing focus in your study plan.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Question Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Question 3:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Application on Compute Engine needs more RAM than initially provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Points:</strong> Technical details (RAM, CPUs), local storage, cost minimization.</li>
      <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Adjust resources to minimize costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Steps:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Determine appropriate machine type.</li>
          <li>Decide on preemptible instances.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Elimination Process:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Preemptible machines are unsuitable due to local storage requirement.</li>
          <li>Choose custom instances to optimize costs based on memory needs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Question 4:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Set up Dedicated Interconnect with non-overlapping IP addresses in RFC 1918 Class B address space.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Points:</strong> Same regions as data centers, no IP conflicts, custom subnetting.</li>
      <li><strong>Options:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Custom Mode VPC Network:</strong> Offers control over subnets and IP ranges.</li>
          <li><strong>Eliminations:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Default networks and auto mode create subnets automatically, which may not meet the requirements.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Question 9:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Migrate VMs to containers and automate the process.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Points:</strong> Mixed environment, container benefits, migration automation.</li>
      <li><strong>Options:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Migrate for Anthos:</strong> Automates migration to GKE.</li>
          <li><strong>Eliminations:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Cloud Build and Migrate for Compute Engine do not support container migration.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Analysis Tips</h3>
<p>Use these strategies to effectively approach and answer diagnostic questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the question stem carefully to identify key points and requirements.</li>
  <li>Break down questions into parts and evaluate each requirement.</li>
  <li>Compare responses to find similarities and differences.</li>
  <li>Eliminate options that do not meet the requirements.</li>
</ul>
