<h1>Case Study Preparation and Your Next Steps</h1>

<h2>Module Overview (video)</h2>
In Module 6, you'll learn how to analyze a case study for the certification exam and start developing your personalized study plan.

<h2>Analyzing a Case Study: Dress4Win (video)</h2>
<p>In preparing for the certification exam, you'll need to analyze case studies that describe fictitious business scenarios. Review official case studies from the exam guide and consider designing solutions for each case. The analysis process involves:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Understanding overarching goals.</li>
    <li>Identifying and itemizing objectives.</li>
    <li>Categorizing and prioritizing objectives.</li>
    <li>Analyzing objectives.</li>
    <li>Determining preliminary options.</li>
    <li>Refining options.</li>
    <li>Identifying the final solution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Use the provided case studies, like "Dress for Win," to practice these steps. Case studies include a company overview, solution concept, existing technical environment, business and technical requirements, and an executive statement outlining priorities and challenges.</p>

<h2>Understand overarching goals (video)</h2>
<p>The first step in analyzing a case study is to read it thoroughly to understand the overarching goals. As you review the "Dress for Win" case, consider the organization's objectives, any timelines, and limiting factors. Look for emerging themes, such as online retail or mobile applications, and note these as they guide your detailed analysis.</p>

<p>At the end of this step, identify the organization's goals and objectives. Utilize resources like the Cloud Architecture Center, which offers reference architectures, and Google Cloud's blog and YouTube channel for useful design insights. These resources can help you combine different solutions to address your needs.</p>

<h2>Identify and itemize objectives (video)</h2>
<p>The next step in analyzing a case study is to identify and itemize the objectives by breaking down complex problems into simpler ones. This helps ensure that all relevant objectives, including those not directly mentioned, are considered.</p>

<p>Rewrite each sentence from the case study as an objective. If necessary, split complex sentences into multiple objectives. Pay attention to key words like "all," "never," and "must" which might influence solution choices or eliminate options.</p>

<p>After listing the objectives, review them to ensure clarity and completeness. This methodical approach ensures no objectives are overlooked and provides a clear, actionable list for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Categorize and prioritize objectives (video)</h2>
